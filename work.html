      <p>
        Starting at 16 I spent 4 summers in the labs at Regeneron. I greatly
        enjoyed my time here as I built a wonderful relationship with my Boss
        and Collogues. I learned many professional development skills. This past
        summer I worked in NYC at Pfizer Inc. in the Mergers and Acquisitions
        group. I liked the work so much I decided to recruit for Investment
        Banking. I am interning at Cowen next summer and I am very excited.
